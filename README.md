# Stopwatch-ATmega32

Hallo, all
This is a mini project of my Embedded software basic diploma at "EDGES for training"

A summery of the project: it is a stopwatch that appears on a 7Segment and has 3 buttons to control it (RESET, STOP, and CONTINUE).

o	Utilized: GPIO, Timer, External Interrupts, and 7-Segment Display.

o	Microcontroller: ATmega32.

You can read the full requirments in the attached file.

Thank you.
